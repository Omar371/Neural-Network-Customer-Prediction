# Predicting Car Purchase Possibility by Customers Using Tuned Neural Network


Abstractâ€”The problem that is discussed in this project aims to predict whether a specific person is most likely to buy a car or not based on their information. Predicting the likelihood of customers to purchase
cars helps companies to identify which groups of people are least likely to buy cars and target their
offers and advertisements towards this group of people, it also helps companies to develop offers
that suit a specific group based on their age, gender, or salary. A dataset that contains information
about the previous customers for a company and whether they purchased a car or not is used to
solve this problem.


## Implementation 
### Dataset 
New Car Sales in Norway, Monthly car sales for 2007-2017 by make and most popular models
